# SCC0251 - Assignment 1: Image Intensity Transformation

In this assignment we had to implement different methods in order to transform images intensity.
Read the instructions for each step in the "dip_t01_intensity_transformation.pdf" document. 
We used python 3 with the numpy and imageio libraries.

The program allows the user to provide parameters in order to read the image and apply the follow methods:
- Inversion;
- Constrast modulation:
- Logarithmic Function Transformation, and;
- Gamma adjustment.

The input image is grayscale and in the unit8 format.
